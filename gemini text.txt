create a website that asks for 7 input values.  input 1 - number of blue resource choice boxes, input 2 - number of purple resource choice boxes, input 3 - number of gold resource boxes, input 4 amount of wood in millions, input 5 amount of iron in millions, input 6 amount of electricity in millions, input 7 amount of each resource required for upgrade.  Take input 1 and times it by 10000, input 2 and times 100000 and input 3 and times it by 1000000 then divide this new amount by 1000000 and save it as box_total.  Add together input 4, input 5 and input 6 and save it as resource_total.  Take input 7, multiply it by 3 and save it as required_total. Display box_total, resource_total and required_total.  Take required_total, subtract resource_total then subtract box_total and save it as upgrade_amount and display the answer. inputs 1, 2 and 3 can only be a whole number, inputs 4,5 and 6 can be 1 decimal place. If upgrade_amount is more than zero then display in red text "You are short by 'upgrade_amount'. If upgrade_amount is less than zero display in green text "You have enough resources to start building and will have 'upgrade_amount' spare" but remove the - symbol from required amount.
